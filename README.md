# Generative-Models

Code for GANs, VAEs, etc.

Unless otherwise stated, you can assume the following:

- Python 3.5
- TensorFlow 1.3

Though I will try to keep the individual project READMEs more up to date.

To run the code go inside a directory (e.g. `gan`) and run `main.py`. Every
directory should have its own `main.py` file which contains the command line
arguments and/or configuration stuff. Maybe it would be useful to get a few bash
scripts set up.
